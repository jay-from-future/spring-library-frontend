                A library is a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a
                defined
                community for reference or borrowing. It provides physical or digital access to material, and
                may be a
                physical building or room, or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include
                books,
                periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes,
                videotapes,
                DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, and other formats. Libraries range in size
                from a few
                shelves of books to several million items. In Latin and Greek, the idea of a bookcase is
                represented by
                Bibliotheca and Bibliothēkē (Greek: βιβλιοθήκη): derivatives of these mean library in many
                modern languages,
                e.g. French bibliothèque.
